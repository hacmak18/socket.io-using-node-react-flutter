# socket.io-using-node-react-flutter
socket.io demonstration using node.js as a server and reactjs and flutter and frontend/client

In this demo i have used : 
1. socket.io: ^4.1.3 npm package as a server
2. socket.io-client: ^4.1.3 npm package as a client (react)
3. socket_io_client: ^2.0.0-beta.2 flutter package | i have not used latest stable package "socket_io_client: ^1.0.1" because it is not compatible with server version.        

NOTE : WHILE RUNNING NODE SERVER LOCALLY USE IP ADDRESS INSTEAD OF LOCALHOST
